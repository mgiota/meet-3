# meet App

The meet App will be a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a test-driven development technique. The application uses the Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming events.

## Features

1. Filter events by city
2. Show/hide event details
3. Specify number of events
4. Use the app when offline
5. Add an app shortcut to the home screen
6. View a chart showing the number of upcoming events by city

## User Stories

1. As a user, I should be able to filter events by city, so that I can see the list of events that take place in that city.
2. As a user, I should be able to show and hide an event's details, so that I can learn more about an event when I need more detailed information.
3. As a user, I should be able to specify the number of events that are shown, so that I can tailor the way I scroll through the events to my current device or my needs.
4. As a user, I should be able to use the app when being offline, so that I do not have to rely on having a stable internet connection and am therefore able to use the app in any situation.
5. As a user, I should be able to see event data visualized in a dashboard, so that I can get an overview over certain characteristics of the events quickly and comfortably.
